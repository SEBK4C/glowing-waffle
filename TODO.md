# Glowing Waffle Project Development Plan

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Basic Architecture

- [x] Create project repository
- [x] Initialize Rust project with Cargo
  ```bash
  cargo init --bin
  ```
- [x] Set up project structure (src/, tests/, examples/, benches/)
- [x] Create initial unit test framework
- [x] Add necessary dependencies to Cargo.toml:
  - crossterm (terminal manipulation)
  - rand (for animations and effects)
  - clap (command line argument parsing)
  - criterion (benchmarking)

## Phase 2: Terminal Interaction Layer

- [x] Implement terminal initialization and cleanup
- [x] Set up event handling for user input
- [x] Implement screen buffer for double-buffering
- [x] Add terminal color support
- [x] Create abstraction for cursor positioning
- [x] Write unit tests for terminal functionality

## Phase 3: Waffle Model and Representation

- [x] Design 3D waffle model using ASCII characters
- [x] Implement waffle grid structure
- [x] Create depth representation for 3D effect
- [x] Develop character density mapping for shading
- [x] Implement boundary calculations
- [x] Write unit tests for waffle model

## Phase 4: Rendering Engine

- [x] Create basic ASCII renderer
- [x] Implement z-buffer for proper depth rendering
- [x] Add color mapping functionality
- [x] Develop character selection algorithm based on depth
- [x] Implement viewport and camera controls
- [x] Add "glowing" effect using color intensity
- [x] Write tests for rendering functionality

## Phase 5: Animation and Transformation

- [x] Implement matrix transformations for 3D rotation
- [x] Add animation framework for smooth motion
- [x] Create different movement patterns
- [x] Implement physics-based motion (optional)
- [x] Add transition effects
- [x] Write animation test suite

## Phase 6: Performance Optimization and Benchmarking

- [x] Set up benchmarking framework
- [x] Measure and optimize rendering performance
- [x] Implement adaptive frame rate
- [ ] Optimize memory usage
- [x] Create performance profiling tools
- [x] Run benchmarks across different terminal sizes and configurations

## Phase 7: User Interface and Configuration

- [x] Add command-line argument parsing
- [ ] Implement configuration file support
- [ ] Create user controls for manipulation
- [x] Add help and information display
- [x] Implement different visualization modes
- [x] Write documentation for configuration options

## Phase 8: Testing and Quality Assurance

- [x] Complete unit test coverage
- [x] Add integration tests
- [ ] Test on different terminal emulators
- [ ] Test on different operating systems
- [ ] Address edge cases and failure modes
- [ ] Perform code reviews and refactoring

## Phase 9: Documentation and Examples

- [x] Complete inline code documentation
- [x] Update README with comprehensive information
- [x] Create example configurations
- [ ] Add screenshots and GIFs to documentation
- [ ] Create user guide

## Phase 10: Release and Distribution

- [x] Package for crates.io
- [x] Create release binaries for different platforms
- [x] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Publish release

## CI/CD Implementation

- [x] Set up GitHub Actions for continuous integration
- [x] Implement automated testing on multiple platforms
- [x] Add code linting and formatting checks
- [x] Configure benchmark tracking over time
- [x] Set up automated releases when tagging versions
- [x] Implement code coverage reporting
- [x] Add badges to README for build status, coverage, etc.
- [x] Create PR and issue templates

## Stretch Goals

- [ ] Add audio visualization capabilities
- [ ] Implement interactive mode with user controls
- [ ] Create plugin system for custom visualizations
- [ ] Add network visualization mode
- [ ] Implement system resource visualization
